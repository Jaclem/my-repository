      <h1>Sunapee Mountain</h1>
        <p>At the moment <strong>Sunapee Mountain</strong> is my favorite place to go to.</p>

        <p>The reason being because it is not only a decently far drive in NH (so a mini get-away) but also because
           It's one of the first places Natasia and I went on Vacation</p>

        <p>Oh and let's not forget the AMAZING Mountain Bike course they have! And other sweet activities!</p>

      <h2>Cape Cod</h2>
        <p>Okay so this one is hard to say because I've only really been there once....But that one time
           Natasia and I went was such a fun time and full of good memories that it's hard not to include.</p>

      <h3>Hanging with friends/family</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do is to hang out with my friends and family.
          They're always down to chill and drink a beer which is pretty sick</p>
        <p>Playing video games and drinking a beer is also a pretty damn cool way to
           spend an afternoon</p>

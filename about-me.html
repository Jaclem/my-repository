    <h1>My name is Joshua Clement</h1>
      <p>Some of my favorite things to do are on this page <a href="index.html">Here!</a>.</p>

      <p>You can find out some of my favorite places to visit <a href="my-favorite-places.html">Here!</a>.</p>

      <p>And my first webpage (with the help of Epicodus) <a href="my-first-webpage.html">Here!</a>.</p>

    <h2>Education/Background</h2>
      <p>Not much to say here, really. I graduated <em>High School</em> and went for about a month in College...It didn't work
         out for me though so I dropped out</p>

      <p>After <em>High School</em> I had a few part time jobs doing mundane things until I started working for IBM.</p>

      <p>Here is a list of jobs I had.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Holiday Inn</li>
          <li>Monroe Temp</li>
          <li>Frozurt</li>
          <li>Body Rags</li>
          <li>Ocean State Job Lot</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This one was pretty shitty</li>
            </ul>
          <li>And now IBM</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>The main reason I want to learn programming</h3>

        <p>Up until a few months of working at IBM and sitting with my <strong>co-workers</strong> (Who are software Engineers) and sharing jokes and
           different Ideas did I notice that I really liked not only the people I worked with but the atmosphere of which I work. After
           they told me what they do here I got really interested in Web Development and heard about Epicodus. This has given me
           and Motivation to actually go for something that could be a possible career...something I have an interest for and could
           also make a living. I have always loved computers so it just makes sense to actually learn how to use them properly</p>

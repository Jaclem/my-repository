    <h2>Education/Background</h2>
      <p>Not much to say here, really. I graduated <em>High School</em> and
         went for about a month in <span class="green">College...It didn't work</span>
         out for me though so I <span class="make-this-red">dropped out</span></p>

      <p>After <em>High School</em> I had a few part time jobs doing mundane things until I started working for IBM.</p>

      <p>Here is a list of jobs I had.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Holiday Inn</li>
          <li>Monroe Temp</li>
          <li>Frozurt</li>
          <li>Body Rags</li>
          <li class="hate">Ocean State Job Lot</li>
            <ul>
              <li class="hate">This one was pretty <span class="brown">shitty</span></li>
            </ul>
          <li>And now IBM</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>The main reason I want to learn programming</h3>

        <p>Up until a few months of working at <em>IBM</em> and sitting with my <strong>co-workers</strong>(Who are software Engineers) and sharing jokes and
           different Ideas did I notice that I really liked not only the people I worked with but the atmosphere of which I work. After
           they told me what they do here I got really interested in Web Development and heard about Epicodus. This has given me
           and Motivation to actually go for something that could be a possible career...something I have an interest for and could
           also make a living. I have always loved computers so it just makes sense to actually learn how to use them properly</p>
      <h4>Here is a picture of my friends and I!</h4>

          <p>This is a picture of my friends and I! Over to the very left is my friend Sandy,
             in the middle is my friend Jared, and over to the very right is me!</p>

      <h5>Some things I like to do</h5>
        <p>I know, I know I already added a link to a list of my favorite things to do but this
           will just show a few of my favorites!</p>

        <p>So if you knew me you'd know that I'm a really friendly easy going person
           I'm pretty easy to talk to and love hanging out with people but here's a few
           things to know as well as that.</p>

      <h6>Mountain Biking</h6>
      <div class="make-red">
        <p>Mountain Biking is BY FAR my <em>favorite</em> sport. I love riding through technical trails
           and trying to rip through as fast as possible. It's so sick. I just love the feeling of
           coming out tired as all hell at the end of the day and just stoked that I had an amazing time</p>

        <p>One of the reasons I want to be a developer is because of the freedom you have. When working in a tech
           company (much like the one I work now) but specifically as a <em>dev</em> they give you so much freedom.
           Not only does a <em>dev</em>job pay extremely well (which could help me afford a nice Mountain Bike)
           but as well there's so much freedom to do what you want and express yourself.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that in this job there are <strong>A LOT</strong>of like minded people. Most everyone I have met
           (unlike at other jobs) share similar interests and opinions on things such as politics, music, and TV shows.</p>

        <p>The atmosphere is just amazing with amazing people. I love that everyone shares similar views and interests.
           I know many people who not only listen to similar music as I do here but also go out on the weekends and
           go Mountain Biking, hiking, skydiving, and much more interesting stuff (One of the things stopping me from
           doing these things is lack of money)</p>

        <p>A dev job would honestly fit me perfectly in what I want to do with my time at work as well as my free time.
           building apps, doing adventurous things on the weekends and much more.</p>
